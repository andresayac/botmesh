README rework for the stable line: one structure (what it is, install, quick start, options, errors, links), a single note about the prerelease dist-tag instead of hard-coded `@alpha` commands, no stale "alpha/experimental" banners, English examples and canonical option names only. Fixes wrong samples: `secureFetch` resolves `{ url, response, body }` with the body already read (the old sample called `response.json()`), the Meta webhook sample keeps the raw body with `express.raw()` (no `any` casts), the Meta pricing sample was not valid TypeScript, and the Redis Cluster sample passes `rootNodes` as URL strings. Documents the previously missing exports (`assertSafeTarget`, `isAllowedHostUrl`, `isPrivateAddress`, `graphRequest`, `DEFAULT_GRAPH_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS`) and the errors users hit (pnpm build scripts, `better-sqlite3` on Node.js 24.19, Graph `190`/`100`/`131030`, Telegram `404`).
